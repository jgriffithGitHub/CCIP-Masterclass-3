This is a collection of code produced when I attended Chainlink's CCIP Bootcamp. 

The Day2Homework and Day3Homework areas include only the resources that I created. They have separate README files that provide instructions on how to use these resources. I've done this to avoid replicating Chainlink repositories or creating submodules.
